            <h2> My Skills</h2>
            <p>My first major skill that will help in the workplace is that I am very good at managing my time and have
                often set a schedule for myself throughout the day. I am very good at understanding what I read the
                first
                time I read it and can follow written instruction very well. When I am focused on things I give my full
                attention to it and will keep working at that thing. Unfortunately sometimes when I am too focused on
                things I tend to ignore things that happen around me. I have also learned the coding languages of HTML
                and
                CSS.</p>
