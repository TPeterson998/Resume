            <h2>Employment</h2>
            <p>I have had many opportunities to work in the past. I have babysat for several families some of them
                regularly. I have also mowed laws of two families regularly but both of them moved and the people that
                moved into the houses didnâ€™t need or want my help in tending to their grass. I worked for the <a href="https://www.peoriaaz.gov/government/departments/parks-recreation-and-community-facilities/recreation-programs/aquatics">city
                    as a lifeguard</a> for a summer and was invited to continue to work as a lifeguard. While working
                as
                a lifeguard I never had to perform medical help to anyone but was drilled several times and there were
                times when there were other lifeguards closer to the person who needed medical attention and I worked
                crowd
                control instead. I also work for my old <a href="https://www.peoriaunified.org/">school district</a> as
                a student worker. Every day
                at school during my
                lunch hour I serve food to the other students and get paid for it. I also take out the trash and help
                get things out of storage as a student worker in the cafeteria as well. </p>
